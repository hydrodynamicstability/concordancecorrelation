# concordancecorrelation

This repository holds a slightly revised version of the R code used to generate all plots and simulations reported in my JSM 2011 conference paper:

C. Tong, 2011: Concordance correlation coefficient decomposed into the product of precision and accuracy. *Joint Statistical Meetings 2011*, 30 July-4 August 2011, Miami Beach, FL. *American Statistical Association 2011 Proceedings, Biometrics Section*, 649-662.

The paper may be viewed at [https://www.academia.edu/8840828/Concordance_correlation_coefficient_decomposed_into_the_product_of_precision_and_accuracy](https://www.academia.edu/8840828/Concordance_correlation_coefficient_decomposed_into_the_product_of_precision_and_accuracy).

This code is provided in the interest of reproducible research.
